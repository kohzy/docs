For secure access to protected resources, requests to the Mangrove API need to be authenticated in order to identify the requesting party and their role.

## Prerequisites

To connect to the API, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Bearer Token**: Obtain a JWT access token

## Making Authenticated API Requests

To make authenticated API requests, include the obtained access token in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP request:

```
Authorization: YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Error Handling

Ensure your implementation handles various error scenarios, including token expiration, unauthorized access, and network errors.
